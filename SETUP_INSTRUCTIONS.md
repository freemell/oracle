## 📁 Component Location

The hero component has been placed at:
```
components/ui/hero-ascii-one.tsx
```

This follows the **shadcn/ui standard structure** where all reusable UI components are placed in the `/components/ui` directory.

## 🎨 Why `/components/ui`?

The `/components/ui` directory is the standard location for shadcn/ui components because:

1. **Consistency**: All reusable UI components are in one place
2. **Discoverability**: Easy to find and import components
3. **Scalability**: As you add more shadcn components, they'll all be here
4. **Best Practice**: Follows the established shadcn/ui convention
